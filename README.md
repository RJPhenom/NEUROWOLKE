## //: BACKGROUND ü§ñ
You are Detective Richter, a neuro-op in the cyberpunk dystopian colonies of the Herrschaft Deutsche, comprising the systems of the Solar North.  

In your role as a detective, you must analyze INSCOP () reports to identify subjects‚Äô possible relation to a criminal organization of KUNSTGEIST (Androids), through the application of something called a GEIST-KAMPFF TEST.  

This test measures emotional responses. Artificial intelligences have come a very long way by the year 2192, but still lack the emotional dimension of ANGST ‚Äî existential despair‚Ä¶ By this metric, undercover agents of DAS KORPORATION may be identified and spared, sparing your life: for incorrectly frying a Korporation netrunning agent is punishable by death, even for law enforcement.

However, this does not mean they will always act overtly emotive, or seem obviously caring or scared. They may act over-brave to disguise their fear, but this is a sign of humanity as well.

The player will have to engage in a moderately long conversation before the option to make a deduction will begin to appear as an option. The dialogue will progress first by notifying the subject of the decision and then asking for their feelings on it: e.g. ‚ÄúWell, Mr. Gro√ü, I have come to the conclusion that you are likely an android, and I will be terminating you at the end of our session. Do you have any final thoughts or conclusions you would like to add as your final words?‚Äù

This will be the last opportunity to judge the response of the subject, after which the player will make a final decision and win or lose the game based on their choice, and if it was
